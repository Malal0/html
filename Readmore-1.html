                What is Diarrhea?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you have diarrhea, your bowel movements (or stools) are loose and watery. It’s common and usually not serious.

                    Many people get diarrhea a few times a year. It normally lasts 2 to 3 days. Some people get it more often. It could be because they have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or other conditions.

                <p>
                    Usually, diarrhea happens because of a virus that gets into your gut. Some people call it "intestinal flu" or "stomach flu."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other causes include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Alcohol abuse</li>
                    <li>Allergies to certain foods</li>
                    <li>Medications</li>
                    <li>Diabetes</li>
                    <li>Some cancers</li>
                    <li>Laxative abuse</li>
                    <li>Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Diarrhea may also follow constipation, especially for people who have irritable bowel syndrome.
